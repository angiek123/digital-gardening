# Front Porch v1 (a fork of [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/))

## Prerequisites

> "Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v18.14** and `npm` v9.3.1 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing"

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Fork the Front Porch Repo and use the following format for its name:

[github-username].github.io

For me, that was joshwingreene.github.io.

I recommend that you keep the "Copy the main branch only" option checked.

### Step 2 - Clone your fork to your machine

`git clone https://github.com/[github-username]/[github-username].github.io.git`

ex. https://github.com/joshwingreene/joshwingreene.github.io.git

I recommend that you place it in your Obsidian vault.

For reference, I have a folder called "My Digital Garden" and I have the following two sub-folders inside of it:
- Publisher
- Workbench

I cloned my forked repo into the "Publisher" folder.

### Step 3 - Use the terminal in order to navigate to your front porch folder and then run `npm install` in order to install all of the necessary packages. The dependencies of Front Porch v1.0.0 is consistent with the dependencies that Quartz v4.2.3 relies on.

### Step 4 Disclaimer -  I am not a lawyer, and the information provided is not legal advice. Please consult a qualified legal professional for legal advice specific to your situation.

### Step 4 - Navigate to the LICENSE.txt file and add the following line to the top of the file:

All Rights Reserved.

### Step 5 - Navigate to the quartz.config.ts file and update lines 18 to 60 accordingly

### Step 6 - Update the images in the static folder

### Step 7 - Follow the following steps from Quartz to host your front porch on github

> 1. Head to “Settings” tab of your forked repository and in the sidebar, click “Pages”. Under “Source”, select “GitHub Actions”.

> 2. Commit these changes by doing `npx quartz sync`. This should deploy your site to <github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>.

Whenever you want to update your site, you just need to run `npx quartz sync` after saving your changes.
